<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques53"><strong>Question 54. What Is The Effect On The Transmitted Power Of Am Signal When The Modulation Index Changes From 0.8 To 1?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The total power in an AM is given by </p>
<p>Pt = Pc (1 + m2/2) </p>
<p>Where Pc is the carrier power and m is the modulation index.</p>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p>Pt1 = Pc (1 + 0.82/2) = 1.32 Pc<br/>Pt2 = Pc ( 1 + 12/2) = 1.5 Pc<br/>Increase in power = (1.5 Pc - 1.32 Pc)/ 1.32 Pc<br/>= 0.1364</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques54"><strong>Question 55. Types Of Analog Modulation Are?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Modulation is a process by which some characteristics of signal such as amplitude or phase or frequency are varied in accordance with the instantaneous value of the information signal .  </p>
<p>The signal whose characteristics are varied is known as carrier signal, as it carries the information. The signal that carries the information is known as modulating signal as according to it, the characteristics of carrier signal are varied.</p>
<p><strong>Methods of analog modulations are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Amplitude modulation</li>
<li>Frequency modulation</li>
<li>Phase modulation</li>
</ol></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques55"><strong>Question 56. Analog Communication Indicates?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Analog communication means that the information is transmitted in the form of a continuous signal, such as a sound wave. The signal has varying amplitude or phase or frequency. </p>
<p>Coding is not applied to the signal as in case of digital data. Amplitude modulated signal and frequency modulated signals are the examples of analog communication.</p></p>
