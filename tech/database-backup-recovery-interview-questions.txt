<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques0"><strong>Question 1. One Of My Control File Corrupted And I Am Unable To Start Database. Could You Tell Me How To Perform Recovery?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If one of your control file is missing or corrupted then we have 2 options to recover it. Check alert.log for exact name and location of corrupted control file. Delete it manually and copy from available rest of control file and rename it and start database. Another option is delete corrupted control file and remove name from parameter file/ spfile. After removing said control file from spfile, start your database.</p></p>

We Take Hot Backup Every Day Night. But One Day At Around 4:00 Pm, By Mistake One Table Is Dropped By Application User. Table Is Very Important. How To Recover Said Dropped Table?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If your database is running on Oracle 10g/11g/12c version then there is new feature available called Recycle bin. You can recover dropped table from user_recyclebin or dba_recyclebin.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Then you should need to restore backup on your UAT or test database server and enable time based recovery for applying all archives before drop command execution. For an instance, apply archives up to 3:55 PM here.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Yes. You can. It is not recommended because your production database is large database and running 24/7 environment. Restoration and recovery will take downtime. It is better to perform restoration and recovery process on UAT or Test database.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>When use LGWR with SYNC, it means once network I/O initiated, LGWR has to wait for completion of network I/O before write processing. LGWR with ASYNC means LGWR doesn’t wait to finish network I/O and continuing write processing.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Create index file of export dump file using import with index file command. A text file will be generating with all table and index object name with number of rows. You can confirm your require table object from this text file. If you are using datapump then there is parameter called "sqlfile" in impdp.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques9"><strong>Question 10. How Do You Recover From The Loss Of Data File If Database Is Running In Archive Log Mode?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>We can perform this recovery in 2 ways. One is open database mode and another is database mount mode. After taking offline lost datafile, we can bring database open and after that restore lost datafile from last backup. After restoration of datafile we can perform datafile level recovery for applying archive logs and make it online. In database mount mode, we can restore datafile from backup and perform datafile recovery using "Recover datafile" command.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques10"><strong>Question 11. What Is The Complete Recovery?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>During this recovery we are applying all database changes using archives log and make it to up to date. Complete recovery can be done full database level or datafile level or tablespace level. Main concept is to apply all data changes using archive logs and bring database up to recent time.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques11"><strong>Question 12. Why We Should Need To Open Database Using Resetlogs After Finishing Incomplete Recovery?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>When we are performing incomplete recovery it means we bring database to past time or rewind period of time using change based, cancel based or time based recovery. These all recovery make database in prior state of database. The forward sequence number already available after performing recovery, due to mismatching of this sequence numbers and prior state of database, it needs to open database with new sequence number of Redo log and archive logs.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques12"><strong>Question 13. Why Export/data Pump Backup Called As Logical Backup?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Export and datapump dump file doesn't backup or contain any physical structure of database like datafile, control file, redo log file, parameter file, password file. Instead of physical structure, export dump contains logical structure of database like definition of tablespaces, segments, schemas, data of segments etc. Due to these reasons export and datapump dump is called as logical backup.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques13"><strong>Question 14. Have You Faced Any Recovery Scenario? Explain How You Resolved It?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>2 months back, a potential table was dropped by an application developer on our large 24/7 running production database. Immediately he informed us. We have standby database for our production database. We checked that archives didn’t apply to standby database up to dropped timing. We stopped archive applying on standby immediately and open database read only. Took export of dropped table and imported in production database. After finishing appropriate checking of table, again we started archive applying in standby database for refreshing.</p></p>
