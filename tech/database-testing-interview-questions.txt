Re-execution of the same test with different input values to confirm the original defect has been successfully removed is called Re-testing or confirmation Testing.</p>
<p>Retesting is also called Data Driven Testing, but the difference between both is,</p>
<p><strong>Retesting:-</strong> It is a manual testing process whereas application testing done with entire new set of data.</p>
<p><strong>DataDriven Testing(DDT):-</strong>It is an Automation testing process where application will be tested with multiple test data.It is simple and easy than retesting where tester just sit in front of system and enter different new input valuesmanually from front-end interface, it is really boring technique.</p></p>
