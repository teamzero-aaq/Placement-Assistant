<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques0"><strong>Question 1. What Is Difference Between Latch And Flip-flop?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The main difference between latch and FF is that latches are level sensitive while FF is edge sensitive. They both require the use of clock signal and are used in sequential logic. For a latch, the output tracks the input when the clock signal is high, so as long as the clock is logic 1, the output can change if the input also changes.</p>
<p>FF on the other hand, will store the input only when there is a rising/falling edge of the clock. Latch is sensitive to glitches on enable pin, whereas flip-flop is immune to glitches. Latches take fewer gates (also less power) to implement than flip-flops. Latches are faster than flip-flops</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. Difference Between Mealy And Moore State Machine?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A) Mealy and Moore models are the basic models of state machines. A state machine which uses only Entry Actions, so that its output depends on the state, is called a Moore model. A state machine which uses only Input Actions, so that the output depends on the state and also on inputs, is called a Mealy model. The models selected will influence a design but there are no general indications as to which model is better. Choice of a model depends on the application, execution means (for instance, hardware systems are usually best realized as Moore models) and personal preferences of a designer or programmer<br/>B) Mealy machine has outputs that depend on the state and input (thus, the FSM has the output written on edges) Moore machine has outputs that depend on state only (thus, the FSM has the output written in the state itself.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage and Disadvantage</strong></p>
<p>•In Mealy as the output variable is a function both input and state, changes of state of the state variables will be delayed with respect to changes of signal level in the input variables, there are possibilities of glitches appearing in the output variables.</p>
<p>•Moore overcomes glitches as output dependent on only states and not the input signal level.<br/>•All of the concepts can be applied to Moore-model state machines because any Moore state machine can be implemented as a Mealy state machine, although the converse is not true.<br/>•Moore machine: the outputs are properties of states themselves... which means that you get the output after the machine reaches a particular state, or to get some output your machine has to be taken to a state which provides you the output. The outputs are held until you go to some other state Mealy machine:<br/>•Mealy machines give you outputs instantly, that is immediately upon receiving input, but the output is not held after that clock cycle.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. Difference Between One Hot And Binary Encoding?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Common classifications used to describe the state encoding of an FSM are Binary (or highly encoded) and One hot.</p>
<p>A binary-encoded FSM design only requires as many flip-flops as are needed to uniquely encode the number of states in the state machine. The actual number of flip-flops required is equal to the ceiling of the log-base-2 of the number of states in the FSM.A one hot FSM design requires a flip-flop for each state in the design and only one flip-flop (the flip-flop representing the current or "hot" state) is set at a time in a one hot FSM design.</p>
<p>For a state machine with 9- 16 states, a binary FSM only requires 4 flip-flops while a one hot FSM requires a flip-flop for each state in the design FPGA vendors frequently recommend using a one hot state encoding style because flip-flops are plentiful in an FPGA and the combinational logic required to implement a one hot FSM design is typically smaller than most binary encoding styles.</p>
<p>Since FPGA performance is typically related to the combinational logic size of the FPGA design, one hot FSMs typically run faster than a binary encoded FSM with larger combinational logic blocks</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This answers why most signals are active low if you consider the transistor level of a module, active low means the capacitor in the output terminal gets charged or discharged based on low to high and high to low transition respectively. When it goes from high to low it depends on the pull down resistor that pulls it down and it is relatively easy for the output capacitance to discharge rather than charging. Hence people prefer using active low signals.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques33"><strong>Question 34. Difference Between Synchronous And Asynchronous Reset?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Synchronous reset logic will synthesize to smaller flip-flops, particularly if the reset is gated with the logic generating the dinput. But in such a case, the combinational logic gate count grows, so the overall gate count savings may not be that significant. The clock works as a filter for small reset glitches; however, if these glitches occur near the active clock edge, the Flip-flop could go metastable. In some designs, the reset must be generated by a set of internal conditions. A synchronous reset is recommended for these types of designs because it will filter the logic equation glitches between clocks.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantages of synchronous reset:</strong></p>
<p>Problem with synchronous resets is that the synthesis tool cannot easily distinguish the reset signal from any other data signal. Synchronous resets may need a pulse stretcher to guarantee a reset pulse width wide enough to ensure reset is present during an active edge of the clock. if you have a gated clock to save power, the clock may be disabled coincident with the assertion of reset. Only an asynchronous reset will work in this situation, as the reset might be removed prior to the resumption of the clock. Designs that are pushing the limit for data path timing, cannot afford to have added gates and additional net delays in the data path due to logic inserted to handle synchronous resets.</p>
<p><strong>Asynchronous reset:</strong></p>
<p>The biggest problem with asynchronous resets is the reset release, also called reset removal. Using an asynchronous reset, the designer is guaranteed not to have the reset added to the data path. Another advantage favoring asynchronous resets is that the circuit can be reset with or without a clock present.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of asynchronous reset: ensure that the release of the reset can occur within one clock period. if the release of the reset occurred on or near a clock edge such that the flip-flops went metastable.</p></p>
