<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. Different Types Of Communications? Explain.?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>Analog and digital communication.</strong></p>
<p>As a technology, analog is the process of taking an audio or video signal (the human voice) and translating it into electronic pulses. Digital on the other hand is breaking the signal into a binary format where the audio or video data is represented by a series of "1"s and "0"s.</p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques31"><strong>Question 32. What Is Cdma, Tdma, Fdma?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Code division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method utilized by various radio communication technologies. CDMA employs spread-spectrum technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter is assigned a code) to allow multiple users to be multiplexed over the same physical channel. By contrast, time division multiple access (TDMA) divides access by time, while frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) divides it by frequency.</p>
<p>An analogy to the problem of multiple access is a room (channel) in which people wish to communicate with each other. To avoid confusion, people could take turns speaking (time division), speak at different pitches (frequency division), or speak in different directions (spatial division). In CDMA, they would speak different languages.</p>
<p>People speaking the same language can understand each other, but not other people. Similarly, in radio CDMA, each group of users is given a shared code. Many codes occupy the same channel, but only users associated with a particular code can understand each other.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques32"><strong>Question 33. Explain Different Types Of Feedback?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>Types of feedback:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Negative feedback: </strong>This tends to reduce output (but in amplifiers, stabilizes and linearizes operation). Negative feedback feeds part of a system's output, inverted, into the system's input; generally with the result that fluctuations are attenuated.</p>
<p><strong>Positive feedback:</strong> This tends to increase output. Positive feedback, sometimes referred to as "cumulative causation", is a feedback loop system in which the system responds to perturbation (A perturbation means a system, is an alteration of function, induced by external or internal mechanisms) in the same direction as the perturbation. In contrast, a system that responds to the perturbation in the opposite direction is called a negative feedback system.</p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A photodiode is made to detect light quickly a solar cell is made to collect energy from light. They are both typically silicon diodes, but modified to meet their different requirements. A photodiode has to be fast, which means low capacitance, which means small area of silicon.</p>
