<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Lazy loading is a design pattern commonly used in computer programming to defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed.</p>
<p>Lazy loading is loading code only once user needs it. For Example, there is a button on the page, which shows different layout once user pressed it. So there is no need to load code for that layout on initial page load.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques4"><strong>Question 5. What Is A Callback Function?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>JavaScript is read line by line. Sometimes, this can result in what seems like a subsequent line of code being executed prior to an earlier line of code. A callback function is used to prevent this from happening, because it is not called until the previous line of code has fully executed.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques5"><strong>Question 6. Tell Me Why Do We Recommend External Css Or Javascript Versus Inline?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Inline CSS or Javascript has bad impact on site performance.</p>
<p>Your HTML code will weigh more as you use inline scripts, whereas external scripts reduces HTML file size which helps fast rendering of webpage.</p>
<p>HTML code will never be cached so inline scripts. Contrary to that, external dependencies, such as CSS and JavaScript files, will be cached by the visitor's web browser. So it reduces https requests each time user click through web pages.</p>
<p>It is hard to maintain Inline CSS and Javascript code. Where having code in just one centralized location is a lot more preferable than changing exactly the same kind of code snippets spread all over the files in the web site.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques7"><strong>Question 8. Do You Know What Is Cors? How Does It Work?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows many resources (e.g., fonts, JavaScript, etc.) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. It's a mechanism supported in HTML5 that manages XMLHttpRequest access to a domain different.</p>
<p>CORS adds new HTTP headers that provide access to permitted origin domains. For HTTP methods other than GET (or POST with certain MIME types), the specification mandates that browsers first use an HTTP OPTIONS request header to solicit a list of supported (and available) methods from the server. The actual request can then be submitted. Servers can also notify clients whether "credentials" (including Cookies and HTTP Authentication data) should be sent with requests.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There are several reasons why web designers should stop using tables for layouts, and adopt the use of CSS for controlling HTML layouts.</p>
<ol>
<li>It adheres to current W3C web standards and it improves accessibility of the information to a wider variety of users, using a wide variety of user agents.</li>
<li>There are bandwidth savings as large numbers of semantically meaningless &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt; and &lt;td&gt; tags are removed from dozens of pages leaving fewer, but more meaningful headings, paragraphs and lists.</li>
<li>Layout instructions are transferred into site-wide CSS stylesheets, which can be downloaded once and cached for reuse while each visitor navigates the site.</li>
<li>If coded well, CSS makes it easy to apply global changes to the layout</li>
<li>Web pages often have less code, and are much thinner when XHTML and CSS are used</li>
<li>Sites may become more maintainable as the whole site can be restyled or re-branded in a single pass merely by altering the mark-up of the specific CSS, affecting every page which relies on that stylesheet.</li>
<li>New HTML content can be added in such a way that consistent layout rules are immediately applied to it by the existing CSS without any further effort.</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>The purpose of each of the HTTP request types when used with a RESTful web service is as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GET:</strong> Retrieves data from the server (should only retrieve data and should have no other effect).</li>
<li><strong>POST</strong>: Sends data to the server for a new entity. It is often used when uploading a file or submitting a completed web form.</li>
<li><strong>PUT:</strong> Similar to POST, but used to replace an existing entity.</li>
<li><strong>PATCH</strong>: Similar to PUT, but used to update only certain fields within an existing entity.</li>
<li><strong>DELETE</strong>: Removes data from the server.</li>
<li><strong>TRACE:</strong> Provides a means to test what a machine along the network path receives when a request is made. As such, it simply returns what was sent.</li>
<li><strong>OPTIONS:</strong> Allows a client to request information about the request methods supported by a service. The relevant response header is Allow and it simply lists the supported methods. (It can also be used to request information about the request methods supported for the server where the service resides by using a * wildcard in the URI.)</li>
<li><strong>HEAD:</strong> Same as the GET method for a resource, but returns only the response headers (i.e., with no entity-body).</li>
<li><strong>CONNECT</strong>: Primarily used to establish a network connection to a resource (usually via some proxy that can be requested to forward an HTTP request as TCP and maintain the connection). Once established, the response sends a 200 status code and a "Connection Established" message.</li>

Prototypes are more concrete than classes, as they are examples of objects rather than descriptions of format and instantiation.</p>
<p>Prototypes are important in JavaScript because JavaScript does not have classical inheritance based on classes; all inheritances happen through prototypes. If the JavaScript runtime can't find an object's property, it looks to the object's prototype, and continues up the prototype chain until the property is found.</p></p>
