<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><ul>
<li>The DOM is known as Document object model and it allows the accessing of the documents like HTML and XML.</li>
<li>It allows a platform to be language neutral and provide an interface that allows the dynamic usage of the scripts and programs to access the content.</li>
<li>It also provides a way to update the content, structure and style of the document and a way to represent it in any language.</li>
<li>It is used with the language and used to create the objects that can be used as a model to allow the interface to be developed with ease.</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><ul>
<li>onload() and onUpload() are two functions that gets activated or the event gets triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.</li>
<li>onload() event is used to verify and check the user’s visit according to the browser’s type and it loads a version of the event.</li>
<li>It provides the web page information that allows easy access to the website and consists of the information regarding the event that is triggered.</li>
<li>Onload() and onUpload() events uses the cookies to hold down the values given by the users when it enters or leaves the page.</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Basically, the Document Object Model is a way of looking at a document. In that sense, it isn't all that different to CSS, which uses another kind of mental model. CSS uses the idea of selectors to interact with a document. The DOM, on the other hand, views a document as a tree of nodes: element nodes, attribute nodes and text nodes. The DOM provides a vocabulary for targeting and manipulating those nodes.<br/>If a programming language supports the DOM then you can use that same vocabulary to address any kind of markup document.</p>
