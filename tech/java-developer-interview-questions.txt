<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques0"><strong>Question 1. Described Heavy Weight Components Mean In Java Programming?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Heavy weight components like Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), depend on the local windowing toolkit. For example, java.awt.Button is a heavy weight component, when it is running on the Java platform for Unix platform, it maps to a real Motif button. In this relationship, the Motif button is called the peer to the java.awt.Button. If you create two Buttons, two peers and hence two Motif Buttons are also created. The Java platform communicates with the Motif Buttons using the Java Native Interface.</p>
<p>For each and every component added to the application, there is an additional overhead tied to the local windowing system, which is why these components are called heavyweight.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques1"><strong>Question 2. Can You Please Explain The Difference Between Boolean &amp; Operator And The &amp;&amp; Operator In Java Programming?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If an expression involving the Boolean &amp; operator is evaluated, both operands are evaluated. Then the &amp; operator is applied to the operand. When an expression involving the &amp;&amp; operator is evaluated, the first operand is evaluated. If the first operand returns a value of true then the second operand is evaluated. The &amp;&amp; operator is then applied to the first and second operands. If the first operand evaluates to false, the evaluation of the second operand is skipped.</p>
<p>Operator &amp; has no chance to skip both sides evaluation and &amp;&amp; operator does. </p></p>
