<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques0"><strong>Question 1. What Is Python?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on PCs under MS-DOS, Windows, Windows NT, and OS/2.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques1"><strong>Question 2. Is There A Tool To Help Find Bugs Or Perform Static Analysis?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Yes.<br/>
PyChecker is a static analysis tool that finds bugs in Python source code and warns about code complexity and style.<br/>
Pylint is another tool that checks if a module satisfies a coding standard, and also makes it possible to write plug-ins to add a custom feature.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. What Are The Rules For Local And Global Variables In Python?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global. If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere within the function's body, it's assumed to be a local. If a variable is ever assigned a new value inside the function, the variable is implicitly local, and you need to explicitly declare it as 'global'.<br/>
Though a bit surprising at first, a moment's consideration explains this. On one hand, requiring global for assigned variables provides a bar against unintended side-effects. On the other hand, if global was required for all global references, you'd be using global all the time. You'd have to declare as global every reference to a builtin function or to a component of an imported module. This clutter would defeat the usefulness of the global declaration for identifying side-effects.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. How Do I Share Global Variables Across Modules?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The canonical way to share information across modules within a single program is to create a special module (often called config or cfg). Just import the config module in all modules of your application; the module then becomes available as a global name. Because there is only one instance of each module, any changes made to the module object get reflected everywhere. For example:<br/>
config.py:<br/>
x = 0 # Default value of the 'x' configuration setting<br/>
mod.py:<br/>
import config<br/>
config.x = 1<br/>
main.py:<br/>
import config<br/>
import mod<br/>
print config.x</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In general, try copy.copy() or copy.deepcopy() for the general case. Not all objects can be copied, but most can.<br/>
Some objects can be copied more easily. Dictionaries have a copy() method:<br/>
newdict = olddict.copy()<br/>
Sequences can be copied by slicing:<br/>
new_l = l[:]</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques7"><strong>Question 8. How Do I Convert A Number To A String?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>To convert, e.g., the number 144 to the string '144', use the built-in function str(). If you want a hexadecimal or octal representation, use the built-in functions hex() or oct(). For fancy formatting, use the % operator on strings, e.g. "%04d" % 144 yields '0144' and "%.3f" % (1/3.0) yields '0.333'.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques8"><strong>Question 9. What's A Negative Index?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Python sequences are indexed with positive numbers and negative numbers. For positive numbers 0 is the first index 1 is the second index and so forth. For negative indices -1 is the last index and -2 is the penultimate (next to last) index and so forth. Think of seq[-n] as the same as seq[len(seq)-n].<br/>
Using negative indices can be very convenient. For example S[:-1] is all of the string except for its last character, which is useful for removing the trailing newline from a string.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques10"><strong>Question 11. What Is A Class?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A class is the particular object type created by executing a class statement. Class objects are used as templates to create instance objects, which embody both the data (attributes) and code (methods) specific to a datatype.<br/>
A class can be based on one or more other classes, called its base class(es). It then inherits the attributes and methods of its base classes. This allows an object model to be successively refined by inheritance. You might have a generic Mailbox class that provides basic accessor methods for a mailbox, and subclasses such as MboxMailbox, MaildirMailbox, OutlookMailbox that handle various specific mailbox formats.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques11"><strong>Question 12. What Is A Method?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A method is a function on some object x that you normally call as x.name(arguments...). Methods are defined as functions inside the class definition:<br/>
class C:<br/>
def meth (self, arg):<br/>
return arg*2 + self.attribute</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques12"><strong>Question 13. What Is Self?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Self is merely a conventional name for the first argument of a method. A method defined as meth(self, a, b, c) should be called as x.meth(a, b, c) for some instance x of the class in which the definition occurs; the called method will think it is called as meth(x, a, b, c).</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques13"><strong>Question 14. How Do I Call A Method Defined In A Base Class From A Derived Class That Overrides It?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If you're using new-style classes, use the built-in super() function:<br/>
class Derived(Base):<br/>
def meth (self):<br/>
super(Derived, self).meth()<br/>
If you're using classic classes: For a class definition such as class Derived(Base): ... you can call method meth() defined in Base (or one of Base's base classes) as Base.meth(self, arguments...). Here, Base.meth is an unbound method, so you need to provide the self argument.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques14"><strong>Question 15. How Do I Find The Current Module Name?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A module can find out its own module name by looking at the predefined global variable __name__. If this has the value '__main__', the program is running as a script. Many modules that are usually used by importing them also provide a command-line interface or a self-test, and only execute this code after checking __name__:<br/>
def main():<br/>
print 'Running test...'<br/>
...<br/>
if __name__ == '__main__':<br/>
main()<br/>
__import__('x.y.z') returns<br/>
Try:<br/>
__import__('x.y.z').y.z<br/>
For more realistic situations, you may have to do something like<br/>
m = __import__(s)<br/>
for i in s.split(".")[1:]:<br/>
m = getattr(m, i)</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques27"><strong>Question 28. How Do I Make Python Scripts Executable?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>On Windows 2000, the standard Python installer already associates the .py extension with a file type (Python.File) and gives that file type an open command that runs the interpreter (D:Program FilesPythonpython.exe "%1" %*). This is enough to make scripts executable from the command prompt as 'foo.py'. If you'd rather be able to execute the script by simple typing 'foo' with no extension you need to add .py to the PATHEXT environment variable.</p>
<p>On Windows NT, the steps taken by the installer as described above allow you to run a script with 'foo.py', but a longtime bug in the NT command processor prevents you from redirecting the input or output of any script executed in this way. This is often important.</p>
<p>The incantation for making a Python script executable under WinNT is to give the file an extension of .cmd and add the following as the first line:</p>
<p>@setlocal enableextensions &amp; python -x %~f0 %* &amp; goto :EOF</p></p>
